BookTvReminder is a learning project to give me practice with a few technologies:
1) MongodDB & NoRM
2) CSS -- without a real designer to use as a crutch
3) jQueryUI + plugins
4) ASP.NET MVC
... plus a variety of project infrastructure solutions

The functionality of the project is to improve the CSPAN2 BookTV website by making more information available in one interface, without navigating to multiple pages. 

NOTE: This solution is not really setup for others to easily download and open. If I progress to the point where I'm happy with the product, I will add developer-friendliness refactoring to the todo list.
